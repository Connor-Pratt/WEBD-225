			<figcaption  width="50%">Arthur's Seat sits high above the beautiful city of Edinburgh. It
				is only a short hike from the edge of the city and provides a wonderful view of the surrounding area.
				Despite taking up quite a large portion of the landscape in the middle of the city, it is preserved as a natural
				landmark of the country. I found it quite refreshing for such a large city to maintain this remarkable feature
				instead of simply developing it for profit.

			<figcaption  width="50%">Oban is a small port city known for its fresh seafood
				and historic distillery. Given that the town grew up around Oban Distillery,
				which was established in 1794, it's not surprising that it remains a main attraction.
				At the top of the city proper sits a large architectural structure known as
				McCaig's Tower. This "tower" offered the perfect overlook for this particular
				picture.

			<figcaption  width="50%">The Kelpies are 30m high statues made out of
				stainless steel. The name "Kelpies" comes from the mythological, water
				beings whom are believed to inhabit the loches of Scotland. The artist
				decided to depict these statues as horses in appreciation of the strength
				and endurance the animals who allowed Scotland to be where it is today.
